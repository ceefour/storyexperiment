h1. Story Experiment

Attempts to store a "polymorphic story" in 3 different ways:

1. Using Dynamic Value Object (manual)
2. Using Mapped Value Object, via Dozer
3. Using Mapped Value Object, via Smooks
4. Using Spring Data MongoDB

A polymorphic story has 4 variants:

1. @PersonFollowPerson@
2. @PersonLikeArticle@
3. @PersonCommentArticle@
4. @PersonWallPerson@

h3. Extras

As an extra, I also attempt to write 6 random generators for:

1. Person objects
2. Article objects
3. @PersonFollowPerson@ stories
4. @PersonLikeArticle@ stories
5. @PersonCommentArticle@ stories
6. @PersonWallPerson@ stories

h3. TODO

1. Create domain objects using Ecore / EMF. Note: resulting domain objects should "just work" with Dozer mapping, spring Data mapping,
   and technologies such as JAX-RS, Jackson.
2. Add another alternative: MongoEMF (probably won't use it anyway, but interesting)
